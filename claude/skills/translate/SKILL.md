# Translate into English

Reading the file in parameter. Translate the markdown file.

Look after mistakes and weird expression as the author is French. Keep the same tone.

Directly modify the file.

Do NOT modify the frontmatter and reference part (only `## Références` into `## References`).

Translate the filename as well and modify its references in every other markdown files (ignore `node_modules`).

Summarize in the console the changes you've made so I can improve.
